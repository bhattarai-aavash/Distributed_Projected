# Distributed Systems Project

This repository contains all the code developed for the **Distributed Systems Project**. It includes a working implementation of the Peterson lock and several experimental codes related to distributed systems.

## Project Structure

### Folder: `1server`
- **File:** `color.c`  
  This file implements the **Peterson lock** for mutual exclusion.  
  The Peterson lock ensures safe concurrent access to shared resources in a distributed system.

### Other Code
The rest of the repository contains various experimental codes that were used during the development and testing phases of this project. These codes explore different concepts and techniques in distributed systems.
